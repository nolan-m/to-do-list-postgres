To Do List w/ Postgres Databases
################################

- Allow users to create tasks, list them out, and delete them.
Add the ability to have multiple lists. Create a List#tasks method that returns all the tasks in a particular list.
- When you delete a list, make sure that all of the tasks in that list get deleted, too.
- Let users mark tasks as done without deleting them, so that they can view all of their completed tasks later. (Retain the ability to delete tasks as well.)
- Build a feature to let users enter a due date.
- Sort tasks by their due date. Check out the PostgreSQL documentation on ORDER BY - let the database do the sorting, not Ruby.
- Now, let users choose between sorting by soonest due, or latest due. Make class methods for these.
- Give users the option to edit a task's description.
